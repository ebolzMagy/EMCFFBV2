# EMCFFBV2 - ESP32-Based USB HID Force Feedback Device

**EMCFFBV2** is an advanced project that implements a **USB HID (Human Interface Device)** with **Force Feedback (FFB)** capabilities, powered by the **ESP32-S2** or **ESP32-S3** microcontroller. This project is designed for hobbyists and enthusiasts who want to create custom force feedback devices such as gaming controllers, steering wheels, joysticks, or other interactive input devices.

> **Note**: This project is currently in **BETA version**. It is still under active development, and there may be bugs or unfinished features. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated as we work to improve and stabilize the project.

## Key Features
- **USB HID Compliance**: Fully compliant with USB HID standards.
- **Force Feedback Support**: Implements force feedback effects like constant force, sine, square, spring, damper, inertia, and friction.
- **ESP32-S2/S3 Powered**: Utilizes the ESP32-S2 or ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to various hardware configurations.

## Use Cases
- **Gaming Controllers**: Create force feedback-enabled gaming peripherals.
- **Simulators**: Enhance flight or driving simulators.
- **DIY Projects**: Perfect for makers and hobbyists.
