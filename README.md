# EMCFFBV2 – USB HID Force Feedback Firmware

**EMCFFBV2** is an advanced firmware project that transforms supported microcontroller platforms into a **USB HID (Human Interface Device)** with **Force Feedback (FFB)** capabilities.

It is designed for hobbyists, makers, and simulation enthusiasts who want to build custom **force feedback devices** such as steering wheels, joysticks, pedals, and other interactive controllers.

EMCFFBV2 currently supports both **ESP32** and **STM32** platforms, offering flexibility across different hardware ecosystems.

> **Project Status**  
> EMCFFBV2 is currently in **BETA** and under active development.  
> Some features may be incomplete or subject to change. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
